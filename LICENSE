MICROSOFT PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT ADAPTIVE CARD PREVIEWER EXTENSION FOR VISUAL STUDIO CODE

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation
(or based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the pre-release 
software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for 
the software, except to the extent those have different terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

1. PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.

   This software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly or work 
   the way a final version will. Microsoft may change it for the final, commercial version.
   Microsoft is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support, or updates to you 
   for the software.

2. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

   You may install and use any number of copies of the software for the purposes of 
   evaluating it and providing feedback to Microsoft.

3. FEEDBACK.

   If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, 
   without charge, the right to use, share, and commercialize your feedback in any way
   and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that 
   requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because 
   we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

4. THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS.

   The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed
   by other agreements, as may be described in the notices file(s) accompanying the software.

5. UPDATES.

   If Microsoft makes bug fixes, security fixes, or other error corrections to the 
   software you agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to install them.

6. DATA COLLECTION.

   The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, 
   and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services 
   and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, 
   but not all, as described in the software documentation. There are also some features 
   in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of 
   your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, 
   including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with 
   a copy of Microsoft’s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located 
   at https://aka.ms/privacy. You can learn more about data collection in the software 
   documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your 
   consent to these practices.

7. SCOPE OF LICENSE.

   The software is licensed, not sold. These license terms only give you some rights 
   to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law 
   gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as 
   expressly permitted in these license terms. In doing so, you must comply with 
   any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain 
   ways. In addition, you may not:

    a. work around any technical limitations in the software;

    b. reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt 
       to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by 
       third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that 
       may be included in the software;

    c. remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers 
       in the software;

    d. use the software in any way that is against the law;

    e. share, publish, rent, or lease the software; or

    f. provide the software as a stand-alone offering or combined with any of your 
       applications for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement
       to any third party.

8. SUPPORT SERVICES.

   Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.

9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

   This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services, 
   and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

10. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.

    You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations 
    that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, 
    end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, 
    visit https://www.microsoft.com/exporting.

11. APPLICABLE LAW.

    If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to 
    interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of 
    the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software 
    in any other country, its laws apply.

12. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.

    These license terms describe certain legal rights. You may have other rights, 
    including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. You may 
    also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. 
    This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state 
    or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software 
    in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following 
    provisions apply to you:

    a. Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law 
       and nothing in these license terms is intended to affect those rights.

    b. Canada. You may stop receiving updates on your device by turning off Internet access. 
       If and when you re-connect to the Internet, the software will resume checking for and 
       installing updates.

    c. Germany and Austria.

        (i) Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as 
        described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, 
        Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.

        (ii) Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, 
        claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or 
        personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

        Subject to the preceding sentence (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight 
        negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, 
        the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, 
        the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance 
        with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). 
        In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES 
    NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR 
    LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS 
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

14. LIMITATION ON DAMAGES. 

    YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. 
    YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, 
    INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content 
    (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; 
    and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, 
    strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility 
    of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because 
    your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, 
    consequential or other damages.
